# greenham's dotfiles

Much of this has been extracted from other users' dotfiles, most notably [ryanb](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) and [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

I'm currently running a bash shell on Ubuntu 13.10 using these dotfiles.

## Installation

### Requirements
